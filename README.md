## FAQ

### I don't want to download this entire repository. How do I get the files for a specific webinar?

Instructions for downloading just the files for a specific webinar are included in each folder. Click on the date for the webinar you want to download and follow the download instructions.

### When will you add today's webinar files?

We try to upload the files as soon as possible, but that isn't always possible. Please allow 7-10 business days for webinar resources to be added.

### A webinar is missing. How do I get the components?

If the files are missing for a 2022 webinar, send us an email at guides@alphasoftware.com with the webinar date to request components. We'll do our best to find them, but sometimes they're not available. Unfortunately, components from 2021 and prior are no longer available if they're not listed here.
